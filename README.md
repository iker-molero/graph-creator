After selecting your graph type, you can customize the values from the value inputs located on the left side of the screen. This section is divided into two input types:

### Graph:

In this section, you can find values like:

- Background color
- Border color

- Labels color
- Label values

### Datasets:

In this section, you can find values such as these for each dataset:

Once you have all the values ready and your graph looks good, you can download it with the button at the bottom right.
